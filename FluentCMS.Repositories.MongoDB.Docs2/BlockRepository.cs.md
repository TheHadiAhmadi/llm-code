# BlockRepository Class Documentation

## Namespace
`FluentCMS.Repositories.MongoDB`

## Inheritance
`BlockRepository` inherits from [[SiteAssociatedRepository<Block>]]. This class cannot be instantiated directly as it serves as a concrete repository implementation.

## Interfaces
`BlockRepository` implements [{IBlockRepository}].

### Constructor

```csharp
public BlockRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)
```
#### Parameters:
- **`mongoDbContext`**: An instance of `IMongoDBContext` that facilitates interaction with the MongoDB database. This is essential for any repository operations.
- **`apiExecutionContext`**: An instance of `IApiExecutionContext`, providing context during API execution, such as user information or request details. This is important for properly associating content with its site.

### Remarks
The `BlockRepository` class provides specific functionalities related to content blocks used within the FluentCMS framework. It allows developers to implement site-specific behaviors while extending the core functionalities provided by the base class. The implementation can be customized to include operations unique to the siteâ€™s requirements.

### Inherited Methods and Properties
Although `BlockRepository` does not introduce new public methods or properties, it inherits several key functionalities from [[SiteAssociatedRepository<Block>]] and implements methods defined in [{IBlockRepository}]. Expected inherited methods include:
- **CreateAsync**: Asynchronously creates a new block.
- **GetByIdAsync**: Asynchronously retrieves a block by its ID.
- **UpdateAsync**: Asynchronously updates an existing block.
- **DeleteAsync**: Asynchronously deletes a block by its ID (if this method is defined in the base class).

These methods are intended for CRUD operations specific to blocks within the FluentCMS system.

### Example Usage
```csharp
// Example of configuring and using BlockRepository
IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext = new MongoDBContext(); // Assume a valid MongoDB context implementation
IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext = new ApiExecutionContext(); // Provide the necessary API execution context

// Initialize the Block Repository
var blockRepository = new BlockRepository(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext);

try {
    // Example: Creating a new block
    var newBlock = new Block { /* Initializing properties */ };
    await blockRepository.CreateAsync(newBlock); // Creates a new block in the database

    // Example: Retrieving a block by ID
    var blockId = Guid.NewGuid(); // Replace with actual block ID
    var block = await blockRepository.GetByIdAsync(blockId); // Retrieves block by ID

    // Example: Updating an existing block
    if (block != null) {
        block.Property = newValue; // Modify desired properties
        await blockRepository.UpdateAsync(block); // Updates the existing block in the database
    } else {
        Console.WriteLine("Block not found.");
    }
} catch (OperationCanceledException e) {
    // Handle cancellation here (if applicable)
    Console.WriteLine("Operation was canceled.");
} catch (Exception ex) {
    // Handle other exceptions related to database operations
    Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
```

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `IMongoDBContext` implementation is properly configured for MongoDB connection settings before using the `BlockRepository`.
- The repository is intended to be used in conjunction with other repositories within the FluentCMS design pattern.
- The `BlockRepository` should be thread-safe, but caution is advised when accessing it concurrently due to its design. It is recommended to manage access to shared resources adequately.
