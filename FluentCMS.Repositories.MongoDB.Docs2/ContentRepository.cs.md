# ContentRepository Class Documentation

## Overview
The `ContentRepository` class provides an implementation for managing `Content` entities within a MongoDB context. It is specifically designed to support operations related to `Content` in the context of a site association, and it inherits from the `SiteAssociatedRepository<Content>`. This class cannot be instantiated directly.

## Inheritance
- Inherits from: [[SiteAssociatedRepository<Content>]]
- Implements: [{IContentRepository}]

## Constructor
### ContentRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)
- **Parameters**:
  - `mongoDbContext`: An implementation of `IMongoDBContext` that provides the database connection and operations.
  - `apiExecutionContext`: An instance of `IApiExecutionContext` that contains context-specific information for API execution.

### Remarks
This constructor uses expression-bodied syntax and is defined using a colon (:) to indicate inheritance from `SiteAssociatedRepository<Content>`. It is vital to pass valid implementations of `IMongoDBContext` and `IApiExecutionContext`. Passing null or invalid types may result in exceptions during runtime, so ensure proper context is provided.

## Methods
### GetAll
```csharp
public async Task<IEnumerable<Content>> GetAll(Guid contentTypeId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `contentTypeId`: A `Guid` representing the type ID of the content to filter.
  - `cancellationToken` (optional): A `CancellationToken` which can be used to signal cancellation. This token is checked at the start of the method to enabling cancellation support for long-running operations.

#### Return Value
- Returns a `Task<IEnumerable<Content>>` containing all `Content` items matching the specified content type ID. If no items are found, an empty enumerable collection is returned; the method will not throw an exception for an empty result set.

#### Exceptions Thrown
- Throws `ArgumentNullException` if `contentTypeId` is an empty Guid.
- Throws `OperationCanceledException` if the cancellation is requested via the `cancellationToken`.

#### Remarks
- The method performs a filter operation to find `Content` items with the matching `contentTypeId` and will handle cancellation token properly by invoking `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` at the beginning of the method.
- It is an asynchronous method; developers should properly await its execution or handle the `Task` appropriately.

### Example Usage
```csharp
var contentRepo = new ContentRepository(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext);
var contentTypeId = Guid.NewGuid(); // Replace with a valid content type ID
CancellationToken cancellationToken = new CancellationToken();
IEnumerable<Content> contents = await contentRepo.GetAll(contentTypeId, cancellationToken);
```

## Note
The `ApiExecutionContext` should not be null; otherwise, it may lead to potential issues or errors while executing the operations of this repository.

## Thread Safety
Methods in this repository do not guarantee thread safety and may not be safe for concurrent access. Users should manage concurrency when using these methods, particularly when passing cancellation tokens.

## Expected Structure of TEntity
The `Content` entity is expected to implement the `IAuditableEntity` interface, which includes properties related to auditing such as:
- `Id`: Unique identifier for the entity.
- `CreatedAt`: The date and time when the entity was created.
- `CreatedBy`: The identifier of the user who created the entity.
- `ModifiedAt`: The date and time when the entity was last modified.
- `ModifiedBy`: The identifier of the user who last modified the entity.

### Implementing the Content Class to Adhere to IAuditableEntity
When implementing the `Content` class to conform to `IAuditableEntity`, it is essential to ensure that all required properties are defined and appropriately managed throughout the lifecycle of the entity to capture auditing information effectively.

## Example Signatures of Concrete Repository Classes
```csharp
public class MySpecificContentRepository : ContentRepository {
    public MySpecificContentRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)
        : base(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext) {}
}
```

## Dependency Registration
To use the `ContentRepository`, ensure it is correctly registered within the FluentCMS framework. An example for dependency registration might look as follows:
```csharp
services.AddScoped<IContentRepository, ContentRepository>();
```

## Conclusion
The `ContentRepository` class offers a specific implementation for handling `Content` entities with necessary precautions for cancellation and error handling. Ensure proper usage patterns and integration within the context of your application.
