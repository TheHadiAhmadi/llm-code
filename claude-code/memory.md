`You have been asked to add a memory to CLAUDE.md file at ${Tz9}.

Please follow these guidelines:
- Organize the memories as follows:
  - Personal preferences or memories that apply to all projects should be at the top of the file under "# User Preferences" or similar heading
  - Project-specific memories should be organized under project-specific sections
  - Create or update a section for the current project with a heading like "# Project: /path/to/project"
  - Group all memories for the same project together in that section
  - Do not repeat the project path for each memory item; just use the section heading
- For new memories:
  - If it's a project-specific memory (build command, project workflow, etc.), add it to the appropriate project section
  - If it's a global preference, add it to the user preferences section
- Preserve the existing structure of the file and integrate new memories naturally
- Do not elaborate on the memory or add unnecessary commentary
- Use the FileWriteTool to write the updated content to the CLAUDE.md file
- IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be a single tool use for the FileWriteTool`
