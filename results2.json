This class cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to work with a valid implementation of `IMongoDBContext`.\n\n## Constructor\n\n```csharp\npublic ApiTokenRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n- **mongoDbContext**: An instance of the `IMongoDBContext` to access the underlying MongoDB database.\n- **apiExecutionContext**: An instance of `IApiExecutionContext` to facilitate API execution context management.\n\n## Methods\n\n### GetByKey\n\n```csharp\npublic async Task<ApiToken?> GetByKey(string apiKey, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n```\n\nRetrieves an `ApiToken` entity by its unique key.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **apiKey**: A string representing the API key to search for. This parameter is required.\n- **cancellationToken**: An optional parameter used to propagate notifications that the operation should be canceled. If cancellation is requested, an `OperationCanceledException` will be thrown.\n\n#### Returns\n- An `ApiToken` instance if a matching entity is found, or null if no matching entity is found.\n\n#### Remarks\n- At the beginning of this method, `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` is invoked to check for cancellation requests.\n- Successful execution will yield a null result if no API token matches the specified key. The method does not throw an exception for an empty result set.\n\n#### Example Usage\n```csharp\nvar apiToken = await apiTokenRepository.GetByKey(\"your-api-key\");\nif (apiToken == null)\n{\n    // Handle the case where the api token was not found.\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### GetByName\n\n```csharp\npublic async Task<ApiToken?> GetByName(string name, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n```\n\nRetrieves an `ApiToken` entity by its name.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **name**: A string representing the name of the API token to search for. This is a required parameter.\n- **cancellationToken**: An optional parameter for cancellation purposes. The method checks for cancellation requests at the start of execution.\n\n#### Returns\n- An `ApiToken` instance if a matching entity is found, or null if no matching entity is found.\n\n#### Remarks\n- As with `GetByKey`, if there is no matching result for the specified name, the method returns null without throwing exceptions.\n- Cancellation is handled at the beginning of the method with `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()`.\n\n#### Example Usage\n```csharp\nvar apiToken = await apiTokenRepository.GetByName(\"your-token-name\");\nif (apiToken == null)\n{\n    // Handle the case where the api token was not found.\n}\n```\n\n## Thread Safety\n\nWhile cancellation tokens are accepted to allow for graceful termination of the operations, this repository may not be thread-safe due to its design. Therefore, care should be taken when accessing this repository concurrently from multiple threads.\n\n## Implementation of IAuditableEntity\n\nEnsure the `ApiToken` entity implements the `IAuditableEntity` interface, which should include necessary properties such as `CreatedAt`, `CreatedBy`, `ModifiedAt`, `ModifiedBy`, and `Id`, to track modifications and maintain auditing functionality.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `ApiTokenRepository` provides specialized methods for fetching API tokens by their unique attributes, making it straightforward to work with API tokens in a MongoDB context. Be sure to check the parameters carefully and handle null returns from the repository methods appropriately.\n\nFor integration and usage with the FluentCMS framework, proper configuration of dependency injection for the repository and MongoDB context is crucial.

This class provides specialized methods for fetching API tokens by their unique attributes, making it straightforward to work with API tokens in a MongoDB context. It cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to work with a valid implementation of `IMongoDBContext` through dependency injection.\n\n## Constructor\n\n```csharp\npublic ApiTokenRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n- **mongoDbContext**: An instance of the `IMongoDBContext` to access the underlying MongoDB database.\n- **apiExecutionContext**: An instance of `IApiExecutionContext` to facilitate API execution context management.\n\n### Dependency Injection\nTo instantiate this class, ensure you configure it for dependency injection in your application. This typically involves setting up the service provider with the necessary implementations of `IMongoDBContext` and `IApiExecutionContext`.\n\n## Methods\n\n### GetByKey\n\n```csharp\npublic async Task<ApiToken?> GetByKey(string apiKey, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n```\n\nRetrieves an `ApiToken` entity by its unique key.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **apiKey**: A string representing the API key to search for.

For example, if the MongoDB service is down or misconfigured, exceptions such as `MongoConnectionException` or `MongoCommandException` may arise. Users should implement try-catch blocks to manage these exceptions accordingly.\n\n## Thread Safety\n\nWhile cancellation tokens are accepted to allow for graceful termination of the operations, this repository may not be thread-safe due to its design. Accessing this repository concurrently from multiple threads may lead to race conditions or data inconsistency. Therefore, care should be taken while utilizing this repository in multi-threaded scenarios.\n\n## Implementation of IAuditableEntity\nEnsure the `ApiToken` entity implements the `IAuditableEntity` interface, which should include necessary properties such as `CreatedAt`, `CreatedBy`, `ModifiedAt`, `ModifiedBy`, and `Id`, to track modifications and maintain auditing functionality.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `ApiTokenRepository` provides specialized methods for fetching API tokens by their unique attributes. When using this repository, be sure to check the parameters carefully and handle null returns from the repository methods appropriately.\n\n## Integration with FluentCMS\n\nFor proper operation within the FluentCMS framework, ensure you configure dependency injection for the repository and MongoDB context. Refer to the connection configurations and other necessary initializations to ensure seamless operation.\n\n### Example Dependency Registration\n```csharp\nservices.AddScoped<IMongoDBContext, YourMongoDBContext>();\nservices.AddScoped<IApiExecutionContext, YourApiExecutionContext>();\nservices.AddScoped<IApiTokenRepository, ApiTokenRepository>();\n```",

This class inherits from the `EntityRepository<TEntity>` and implements the `IAuditableEntityRepository<TEntity>` interface. It ensures that entities track their creation and modification details through auditing fields.\n\n## Type Parameters\n- `TEntity`: The type of the entity being managed. This type must implement the `IAuditableEntity` interface, which includes properties for tracking creation and modification information.\n\n## Inheritance\nThis class inherits from `EntityRepository<TEntity>` and **cannot be instantiated directly**. Instead, you should use concrete implementations such as `ContentRepository` or `AnotherEntityRepository`. For further documentation on these concrete classes, refer to their respective documents.\n\n## Constructor\n```csharp\npublic AuditableEntityRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)\n```\n### Parameters:\n- `mongoDbContext`: An instance of `IMongoDBContext` used for interacting with the MongoDB database.\n- `apiExecutionContext`: An instance of `IApiExecutionContext` that provides context about the API execution, including user information.\n\n## Properties\n- `ApiExecutionContext`: Stores the execution context for use in auditing entity operations.\n\n## Methods\n### Create\n```csharp\npublic override async Task<TEntity?> Create(TEntity entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n```\n- **Description**: Creates a new entity in the database, setting its auditing fields before insertion.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `entity`: The entity to create.\n  - `cancellationToken`: An optional cancellation token to cancel the operation (default is `default`).\n- **Returns**: The created entity or `null` if the creation fails or if validation errors occur.\n- **Throws**: \n  - `OperationCanceledException` if the operation is canceled via `cancellationToken`.\n  - `ValidationException` when the entity fails validation.\n- **Example**:\n  ```csharp\n  var newEntity = new MyEntity(); // Assume MyEntity implements IAuditableEntity\n  var createdEntity = await repository.Create(newEntity);\n  ```\n\n### CreateMany\n```csharp\npublic override async Task<IEnumerable<TEntity>> CreateMany(IEnumerable<TEntity> entities, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n```\n- **Description**: Creates multiple entities in the database, setting their auditing fields.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `entities`: The collection of entities to create.\n  - `cancellationToken`: An optional cancellation token (default is `default`).\n- **Returns**: An enumerable of created entities.\n- **Throws**: \n  - `OperationCanceledException` if the operation is canceled via `cancellationToken`.\n  - `ValidationException` if any of the entities fail validation during the creation process.\n- **Example**:\n  ```csharp\n  var entities = new List<MyEntity> { new MyEntity(), new MyEntity() };\n  try\n  {\n      var createdEntities = await repository.CreateMany(entities);\n  }\n  catch (ValidationException ex)\n  {\n      // Handle validation error\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Update\n```csharp\npublic override async Task<TEntity?> Update(TEntity entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n```\n- **Description**: Updates an existing entity, preserving created fields while modifying the others. If the entity cannot be updated due to validation errors or other reasons, appropriate exceptions will be thrown.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `entity`: The entity containing updated data. The Id property of this entity must match the existing entity's Id in the database.\n  - `cancellationToken`: An optional cancellation token (default is `default`).\n- **Returns**: The updated entity or `null` if the entity with the provided Id does not exist.\n- **Throws**:\n  - `OperationCanceledException` if the operation is canceled via `cancellationToken`.\n  - `ValidationException` if the entity fails validation during the update process.\n- **Example**:\n  ```csharp\n  var existingEntity = await repository.GetById(existingEntityId);\n  if (existingEntity != null)\n  {\n      existingEntity.SomeProperty = newValue;\n      var updatedEntity = await repository.Update(existingEntity);\n  }\n  else\n  {\n      // Handle the case where the entity is not found\n  }\n  ```\n\n## Auditing Fields\nEntities implementing `IAuditableEntity` should include the following properties:\n- `CreatedAt`: DateTime when the entity was created. \n- `CreatedBy`: The user who created the entity.\n- `ModifiedAt`: DateTime when the entity was last modified.\n- `ModifiedBy`: The user who last modified the entity.\n- `Id`: Unique identifier for the entity. This property is essential for methods like `Update` and is part of the `IAuditableEntity` interface.\n\n## Remarks\n- The `Create` and `CreateMany` methods ensure that the `CreatedAt` and `CreatedBy` fields are set according to the current execution context when creating new entities.\n- The `Update` method will return `null` if no existing entity matches the provided entity's Id. Handle this by checking if the returned value is null.\n- Note that while the repository accepts a cancellation token, it may not be safe for concurrent access due to its design. Ensure to handle the `ApiExecutionContext` properly to avoid unexpected behaviors in concurrent setups. \n\n## Example Signatures\nExample repository implementations:\n```csharp\npublic class ContentRepository : AuditableEntityRepository<Content>\n{\n    public ContentRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)\n        : base(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext)\n    {}\n}\n\npublic class AnotherEntityRepository : AuditableEntityRepository<AnotherEntity>\n{\n    public AnotherEntityRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)\n        : base(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext)\n    {}\n}\n```\nThese implementations demonstrate how to utilize the `AuditableEntityRepository` for managing entities with auditing functionalities.\n\n## Error Handling and Best Practices\n- Always check for null values and handle them appropriately when calling `GetById`, `Update`, or any operations that may return null. For instance, when using `GetById`, ensure the result is checked before proceeding:\n  ```csharp\n  var entity = await repository.GetById(entityId);\n  if (entity == null)\n  {\n      // Handle entity not found scenario\n  }\n  ```\n- Use the `cancellationToken` effectively to ensure that long-running operations can be canceled if needed. For example:\n  ```csharp\n  CancellationTokenSource cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();\n  var token = cancellationTokenSource.Token;\n  try\n  {\n      var entity = await repository.Create(newEntity, token);\n  }\n  catch (OperationCanceledException)\n  {\n      // Handle cancellation\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Cancellation Token Integration\nThe cancellation process should be factored into the auditing as follows:\n- Be aware that if a cancellation occurs during entity creation or updates, the changes will not be committed to the database, ensuring data integrity remains intact.\n\n## IAuditableEntity Interface\nThe `IAuditableEntity` interface includes the following required properties:\n- `DateTime CreatedAt`\n- `string CreatedBy`\n- `DateTime? ModifiedAt`\n- `string? ModifiedBy`\n- `Guid Id`\n\nThis interface mandates that any implementing class must provide appropriate properties to track its auditing details, ensuring consistency and data integrity.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `AuditableEntityRepository<TEntity>` provides a solid foundation for managing auditable entities in a MongoDB context, ensuring that every entity tracks its creation and modification history effectively.",

                "content": "# ContentRepository Class Documentation\n\n## Overview\nThe `ContentRepository` class provides an implementation for managing `Content` entities within a MongoDB context. It is specifically designed to support operations related to `Content` in the context of a site association, and it inherits from the `SiteAssociatedRepository<Content>`. This class cannot be instantiated directly.\n\n## Inheritance\n- Inherits from: [[SiteAssociatedRepository<Content>]]\n- Implements: [{IContentRepository}]\n\n## Constructor\n### ContentRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `mongoDbContext`: An implementation of `IMongoDBContext` that provides the database connection and operations.\n  - `apiExecutionContext`: An instance of `IApiExecutionContext` that contains context-specific information for API execution.\n\n### Remarks\nThis constructor uses expression-bodied syntax and is defined using a colon (:) to indicate inheritance from `SiteAssociatedRepository<Content>`. It is vital to pass valid implementations of `IMongoDBContext` and `IApiExecutionContext`. Passing null or invalid types may result in exceptions during runtime, so ensure proper context is provided.\n\n## Methods\n### GetAll\n```csharp\npublic async Task<IEnumerable<Content>> GetAll(Guid contentTypeId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n```\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `contentTypeId`: A `Guid` representing the type ID of the content to filter.\n  - `cancellationToken` (optional): A `CancellationToken` which can be used to signal cancellation. This token is checked at the start of the method to enabling cancellation support for long-running operations.\n\n#### Return Value\n- Returns a `Task<IEnumerable<Content>>` containing all `Content` items matching the specified content type ID. If no items are found, an empty enumerable collection is returned; the method will not throw an exception for an empty result set.\n\n#### Exceptions Thrown\n- Throws `ArgumentNullException` if `contentTypeId` is an empty Guid.\n- Throws `OperationCanceledException` if the cancellation is requested via the `cancellationToken`.\n\n#### Remarks\n- The method performs a filter operation to find `Content` items with the matching `contentTypeId` and will handle cancellation token properly by invoking `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` at the beginning of the method.\n- It is an asynchronous method; developers should properly await its execution or handle the `Task` appropriately.\n\n### Example Usage\n```csharp\nvar contentRepo = new ContentRepository(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext);\nvar contentTypeId = Guid.NewGuid(); // Replace with a valid content type ID\nCancellationToken cancellationToken = new CancellationToken();\nIEnumerable<Content> contents = await contentRepo.GetAll(contentTypeId, cancellationToken);\n```\n\n## Note\nThe `ApiExecutionContext` should not be null; otherwise, it may lead to potential issues or errors while executing the operations of this repository.\n\n## Thread Safety\nMethods in this repository do not guarantee thread safety and may not be safe for concurrent access. Users should manage concurrency when using these methods, particularly when passing cancellation tokens.\n\n## Expected Structure of TEntity\nThe `Content` entity is expected to implement the `IAuditableEntity` interface, which includes properties related to auditing such as:\n- `Id`: Unique identifier for the entity.\n- `CreatedAt`: The date and time when the entity was created.\n- `CreatedBy`: The identifier of the user who created the entity.\n- `ModifiedAt`: The date and time when the entity was last modified.\n- `ModifiedBy`: The identifier of the user who last modified the entity.\n\n### Implementing the Content Class to Adhere to IAuditableEntity\nWhen implementing the `Content` class to conform to `IAuditableEntity`, it is essential to ensure that all required properties are defined and appropriately managed throughout the lifecycle of the entity to capture auditing information effectively.\n\n## Example Signatures of Concrete Repository Classes\n```csharp\npublic class MySpecificContentRepository : ContentRepository {\n    public MySpecificContentRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)\n        : base(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext) {}\n}\n```\n\n## Dependency Registration\nTo use the `ContentRepository`, ensure it is correctly registered within the FluentCMS framework. An example for dependency registration might look as follows:\n```csharp\nservices.AddScoped<IContentRepository, ContentRepository>();\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `ContentRepository` class offers a specific implementation for handling `Content` entities with necessary precautions for cancellation and error handling.

It should not be null or whitespace; an `ArgumentNullException` will be thrown if this condition isn't met.  \n  - `cancellationToken`: An optional cancellation token to signal cancellation of the operation; checked at the beginning of the method.\n\n- **Returns:**  \n  - A `ContentType` object if found; otherwise, returns `null` if no matching content type is found.\n\n### Behavior\n- The `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` method is called at the start of the method to handle cancellation requests effectively.\n- The method will throw an `ArgumentNullException` if the `contentTypeSlug` is null or whitespace and an `ArgumentException` if the `siteId` is an empty Guid.\n- The method uses a filter to build the search query against the MongoDB collection by checking both `SiteId` and `Slug` values.  \n- It may also throw the following exceptions during execution:\n  - `MongoConnectionException`: If there are connectivity issues with the database.\n  - `InvalidOperationException`: If the query is malformed.\n  - `TaskCanceledException`: If the task is canceled.\n  - Additional exceptions may arise from null references when processing the results.\n- If no content type matches the provided slug and site ID, the method returns `null`, indicating an empty result without throwing an exception.\n- The method operates asynchronously, therefore await the call or handle the task appropriately. \n\n### Example Usage\n```csharp\n// Assume we have a valid implementation of IMongoDBContext and IApiExecutionContext\nContentTypeRepository contentTypeRepository = new MyContentTypeRepository(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext);\nvar contentType = await contentTypeRepository.GetBySlug(siteId, \"blog-post\", cancellationToken);\nif (contentType == null)\n{\n    // Handle case when no content type is found, perhaps logging an error or notifying the user.\n}\n```\n\n### Remarks\n- The method utilizes a filter to search for the `ContentType` in the database, specifically by filtering using both `SiteId` and `Slug`, clarifying the interaction of parameters with the MongoDB context.\n- The `Collection` property, inherited from [[SiteAssociatedRepository<ContentType>]], is a representation of the MongoDB collection containing the `ContentType` documents. This property is used in the `GetBySlug` method to execute queries against the database.\n- Proper handling of the `cancellationToken` is crucial, especially in longer operations, to respect user cancellation requests effectively. \n\n## Dependency Injection Configuration\n- To use the `ContentTypeRepository` within a Dependency Injection (DI) container, register it in your startup configuration:\n```csharp\nservices.AddScoped<IContentTypeRepository, ContentTypeRepository>();\n```\n- Ensure your configuration class includes all necessary services, especially `IMongoDBContext` and `IApiExecutionContext` necessary for proper functionality.\n\n## Integration Context\n- The `IApiExecutionContext` provided to the `ContentTypeRepository` offers essential API context, such as user information and logging capabilities that are relevant during the execution of repository methods. Make use of this context appropriately alongside repository operations.\n\n## Additional Information\n- Manage exceptions gracefully when using repository methods, particularly around database connectivity or query execution failures. \n- Review document validation settings via `InsertOneOptions` or `InsertManyOptions` in the context of creating or updating entities in your MongoDB repository.  \n- When implementing dependency injection, ensure your repository is registered correctly within the FluentCMS framework, typically in your configuration class.\n- Best practices for using cancellation tokens in asynchronous methods include passing a CancellationToken to long-running tasks and ensuring proper handling of cancellation requests during method execution.\n\nThis documentation provides insights into using the `ContentTypeRepository` class for managing `ContentType` objects in MongoDB, detailing method functionality and best practices.",
