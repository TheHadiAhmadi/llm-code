Ensure cancellation requests are checked frequently using `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` to prevent unnecessary processing. Best practices include passing cancellation tokens from higher-level service methods to avoid potential performance hits.\n\n## Auditing in Create/Update\nThe `ApiTokenRepository` manages the auditing fields during any Create or Update operations, tracking changes automatically. Ensure correct validation is performed during these operations to prevent errors and inconsistency in auditing data. The audit lifecycle impacts the visibility and tracking of changes across different entities.\n\n## Error Handling\nWhen interacting with MongoDB, streamline error handling using common exceptions like `MongoConnectionException` and `InvalidOperationException`. Implement error handling patterns, such as retry mechanisms or fallback strategies, especially for methods like `FindAsync` that interact with potentially transient external service failures. Always log error details for troubleshooting.\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n1. **Connection Timeouts**: Ensure your MongoDB instance is reachable from your application environment. Validate your connection string and firewall settings.\n2. **Invalid API Tokens**: Check the format of `apiKey` and `name` parameters in `GetByKey` and `GetByName`. Validation should align with business rules regarding token strings.\n3. **Handling Task<ApiToken?>**: When retrieving tokens, always check for null results and incorporate error logging to document retrieval issues for future resolution.\n\n## Getting Started\nTo instantiate `ApiTokenRepository`, ensure that `IMongoDBContext` and `IApiExecutionContext` are properly configured within your dependency injection setup, particularly in the context of the FluentCMS framework. Verify that both dependencies are registered correctly to avoid null reference exceptions during initialization.\n\n## Contributions\nContributions to `ApiTokenRepository` are welcome!

This includes logging the user who made the change and timestamps for operations. Ensure correct validation is performed during these operations to prevent errors and inconsistency in auditing data. The audit lifecycle impacts visibility and tracking across entities, making it imperative to adhere to best practices in maintaining the integrity of the audit record.\n\n## Error Handling\nWhen interacting with MongoDB, streamline error handling using common exceptions like `MongoConnectionException` and `InvalidOperationException`.

Always log error details for troubleshooting and review known exception scenarios to assist in both development and runtime error handling.\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n1. **Connection Timeouts**: Ensure your MongoDB instance is reachable from your application environment. Validate your connection string and firewall settings by testing connectivity with the MongoDB shell or a GUI client.\n2. **Invalid API Tokens**: Check the format of `apiKey` and `name` parameters in `GetByKey` and `GetByName`. Use regular expressions to validate token formats in compliance with your business rules and log any mismatches.\n3. **Handling Task<ApiToken?>**: When retrieving tokens, always check for null results to prevent null reference exceptions. Incorporate error logging where necessary to document retrieval issues for future resolution. For example, if `GetByKey` returns null for an expected token, log the situation with sufficient context to aid further investigation.\n\n## Getting Started\nTo instantiate `ApiTokenRepository`, ensure that `IMongoDBContext` and `IApiExecutionContext` are properly configured within your dependency injection setup, particularly in the context of the FluentCMS framework. Verify that both dependencies are registered correctly to avoid null reference exceptions during initialization. Explore suitable configurations for MongoDB connection strings, ensuring they specify the necessary parameters for your environment.\n\n## Contributions\nContributions to `ApiTokenRepository` are welcome!

If the token is found, it is returned; otherwise, null is returned.  \n- **Parameters:**  \n  - `apiKey` (string): The unique key associated with the API token.  \n  - `cancellationToken` (CancellationToken, optional): Allows for operation cancellation. It defaults to a new cancellation token.  \n- **Returns:**  \n  - `Task<ApiToken?>`: A task representing the asynchronous operation, with the result being the `ApiToken` associated with the provided key or null.  \n- **Exceptions:**  \n  - Throws `OperationCanceledException` if cancellation is requested via `cancellationToken`.  \n  - Throws `MongoConnectionException`  if there is a connectivity issue or an invalid connection string.\n- **Example Usage:**  \n```csharp  \nvar apiToken = await apiTokenRepository.GetByKey(\"your-api-key\", cancellationToken);  \nif (apiToken == null)  \n{  \n    // Handle null case (e.g., log not found)  \n}  \n```\n\n### `Task<ApiToken?> GetByName(string name, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`  \n- **Visibility:** public  \n- **Description:**  Fetches an `ApiToken` by its name. Returns the token if it exists; otherwise, returns null.  \n- **Parameters:**  \n  - `name` (string): The name of the API token to search for.  \n  - `cancellationToken` (CancellationToken, optional): Allows for operation cancellation. It defaults to a new cancellation token.  \n- **Returns:**  \n  - `Task<ApiToken?>`: A task representing the asynchronous operation, with the result being the found `ApiToken` or null.  \n- **Exceptions:**  \n  - Throws `OperationCanceledException` if cancellation is requested via `cancellationToken`.  \n  - Throws `MongoConnectionException` if there are connectivity issues with the database.\n- **Example Usage:**  \n```csharp  \nvar apiToken = await apiTokenRepository.GetByName(\"TokenName\", cancellationToken);  \nif (apiToken == null)  \n{  \n    // Handle null case (e.g., log not found)  \n}  \n```\n\n## Inheritable Methods\nThis class inherits methods from the `AuditableEntityRepository<T>` which provide various CRUD operations for `ApiToken`. The following methods are available:\n\n### `Create(TEntity entity)`  \n- **Visibility:** public  \n- **Parameters:** `entity` (ApiToken): The `ApiToken` to be created.  \n- **Returns:** `Task` indicating the completion of the operation.  \n- **Exceptions:**  \n  - Throws `MongoWriteException` for validation errors,  \n  - `OperationCanceledException` if cancellation is requested.  \n- **Example Usage:**  \n```csharp  \nawait apiTokenRepository.Create(new ApiToken { /* properties */ });  \n```\n\n### `Update(TEntity entity)`  \n- **Visibility:** public  \n- **Parameters:** `entity` (ApiToken): The `ApiToken` to be updated.  \n- **Returns:** `Task` indicating the completion of the operation.  \n- **Exceptions:**  \n  - Throws `MongoWriteException` for validation errors,  \n  - `KeyNotFoundException` if the entity ID does not exist,  \n  - `OperationCanceledException` if cancellation is requested.  \n- **Example Usage:**  \n```csharp  \nawait apiTokenRepository.Update(existingApiToken);  \n```\n\n### `Delete(TKey id)`  \n- **Visibility:** public  \n- **Parameters:** `id` (string): The unique identifier of the `ApiToken` to delete.  \n- **Returns:** `Task` indicating the completion of the operation.  \n- **Exceptions:**  \n  - Throws `KeyNotFoundException` if the ID does not correspond to an existing token,  \n  - `OperationCanceledException` if cancellation is requested.  \n- **Example Usage:**  \n```csharp  \nawait apiTokenRepository.Delete(\"token-id\");  \n```\n\n### `GetById(TKey id)`  \n- **Visibility:** public  \n- **Parameters:** `id` (string): The unique identifier of the `ApiToken` to retrieve.  \n- **Returns:** `Task<ApiToken?>`: The matching `ApiToken` or null.  \n- **Exceptions:**  \n  - Throws `OperationCanceledException` if cancellation is requested.  \n  - Throws `MongoConnectionException` if there are connectivity issues while querying.  \n- **Example Usage:**  \n```csharp  \nvar apiToken = await apiTokenRepository.GetById(\"token-id\");  \nif (apiToken == null)  \n{  \n    // Handle not found  \n}  \n```\n\nRefer to the [AuditableEntityRepository<ApiToken>] documentation for further details on inherited methods.\n\n## Cancellation Handling\nAll methods in `ApiTokenRepository`, including inherited ones, should consistently call `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` at the beginning of their implementations. This pattern allows for immediate cancellation if necessary, promoting responsiveness in long-running operations. If an operation is canceled, avoid processing further to save resources and handle errors gracefully.\n\n## Auditing in Create/Update\nThe `ApiTokenRepository` manages the auditing fields during Create or Update operations, tracking changes automatically. This includes logging the user who made the change and timestamps for operations. Ensure correct validation is performed during these operations to prevent errors and inconsistencies in auditing data. The audit lifecycle impacts visibility and tracking across entities, making it imperative to adhere to best practices in maintaining the integrity of the audit record.\n\n## Error Handling\nWhen interacting with MongoDB, streamline error handling using common exceptions like `MongoConnectionException` for connection issues and `InvalidOperationException` for potential mismatches or validation failures. Ensure that documentation for exceptions includes clarity on which operations might throw them to prevent confusion:\n- **GetByKey/GetByName**: `MongoConnectionException`, `OperationCanceledException`  \n- **Create/Update/Delete**: `MongoWriteException`, `KeyNotFoundException`, `OperationCanceledException`  \n- **GetById**: `OperationCanceledException`, `MongoConnectionException`\n\nImplement error handling patterns, such as retry mechanisms or fallback strategies, especially for methods like `FindAsync` that interact with potentially transient external service failures. Always log error details for troubleshooting and review known exception scenarios to assist in both development and runtime error handling.\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n1. **Connection Timeouts**: Ensure your MongoDB instance is reachable from your application environment. Validate your connection string and firewall settings by testing connectivity with the MongoDB shell or a GUI client.  \n2. **Invalid API Tokens**: Check the format of `apiKey` and `name` parameters in `GetByKey` and `GetByName`. Use regular expressions to validate token formats in compliance with your business rules and log any mismatches.  \n3. **Handling Task<ApiToken?>**: When retrieving tokens, always check for null results to prevent null reference exceptions. Incorporate error logging where necessary to document retrieval issues for future resolution. For example, if `GetByKey` returns null for an expected token, log the situation with sufficient context to aid further investigation.\n\n## Getting Started\nTo instantiate `ApiTokenRepository`, ensure that `IMongoDBContext` and `IApiExecutionContext` are properly configured within your dependency injection setup, particularly in the context of the FluentCMS framework. Below is an example of how to configure dependencies and use the `ApiTokenRepository`:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSingleton<IMongoDBContext, MongoDBContext>();\nservices.AddScoped<IApiExecutionContext, ApiExecutionContext>();\nservices.AddScoped<IApiTokenRepository, ApiTokenRepository>();\n\n// Example usage\nvar apiTokenRepo = new ApiTokenRepository(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext);\nvar token = await apiTokenRepo.GetByKey(\"example-api-key\", cancellationToken);\n```\nVerify that both dependencies are registered correctly to avoid null reference exceptions during initialization. Explore suitable configurations for MongoDB connection strings, ensuring they specify the necessary parameters for your environment.\n\n## Contributions\nContributions to `ApiTokenRepository` are welcome! Please adhere to the coding standards and ensure that all changes are documented to enhance clarity and maintainability. Additionally, consider subscribing to typical patterns of event logging related to auditing functionality for better monitoring of key operations.",

It extends the `SiteAssociatedRepository` class, inheriting its functionalities while providing content-specific operations.\n\n## Constructor\n\n### `ContentRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)`\n- **Parameters:**  \n  - `mongoDbContext`: An instance of `IMongoDBContext`, required for MongoDB operations.  \n  - `apiExecutionContext`: An instance of `IApiExecutionContext`, containing context-specific information for the API execution.  \n\n> **Note:** Ensure that neither `mongoDbContext` nor `apiExecutionContext` is null when constructing the repository to avoid runtime exceptions.\n\n## Methods\n\n### `GetAll(Guid contentTypeId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`\n- **Visibility:** `public`\n- **Parameters:**  \n  - `contentTypeId`: A `Guid` representing the type of content to filter by.  \n  - `cancellationToken`: An optional `CancellationToken` for proper cancellation support during long-running operations. Defaults to `default`.  \n  \n- **Returns:**  \n  - A `Task<IEnumerable<Content>>` representing a collection of `Content` items matching the specified `contentTypeId`.\n\n- **Exceptions:**  \n  - `OperationCanceledException`: Thrown if the operation is canceled via the `cancellationToken`.  \n  - `MongoConnectionException`: May occur due to issues with the MongoDB connection during the execution of this method.  \n\n- **Usage Example:**  \n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    var contentRepository = new ContentRepository(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext);\n    var contents = await contentRepository.GetAll(contentTypeId, cancellationToken);\n}\ncatch (OperationCanceledException)\n{\n    // Handle the cancellation scenario here.\n}\ncatch (MongoConnectionException ex)\n{\n    // Handle the connection error, log, or retry logic.\n}\n```\n\n- **Cancellation Handling:**  \nEnsure to call `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` at the beginning of the method to respect cancellation requests early in the operation. This allows responsive stopping of operations initiated by the user or system.\n\n- **Data Handling:**  \nIn scenarios where no content matches the specified `contentTypeId`, an empty list is returned. It’s crucial to handle this in your application logic appropriately to avoid null reference issues when processing the results.\n\n## Inheritable Methods\n\nThis class inherits methods from the `SiteAssociatedRepository&lt;Content&gt;`. The following methods are available for overriding:\n- `Create(Content entity)`\n- `Update(Content entity)`\n- `Delete(Guid id)`\n\n## Best Practices\n- **Cancellation Tokens:** When using cancellation tokens in your client code, ensure to pass this token through layers to maintain awareness of cancellation requests, especially during lengthy database operations.  \n\n- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for all database interactions, especially considering potential connectivity issues with MongoDB and cancellation effects during auditing and other processes.\n\n## Dependencies\n- **IMongoDBContext:** This repository requires implementing `IMongoDBContext` for repository functionalities. \n- **IApiExecutionContext:** Context information for handling API specifics and operations.\n\n## Project Contributions\nFor contributions to the FluentCMS project, please refer to the [contribution guidelines](#).\n\n---",

It is automatically initialized in the base class `SiteAssociatedRepository<Content>` using the provided `IMongoDBContext`.\n\n## Constructor\n### `ContentRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)`\n- **Parameters:**  \n  - `mongoDbContext`: An instance of `IMongoDBContext`, required for MongoDB operations.  \n  - `apiExecutionContext`: An instance of `IApiExecutionContext`, containing context-specific information for the API execution.  \n\n> **Note:** Ensure that neither `mongoDbContext` nor `apiExecutionContext` is null when constructing the repository to avoid runtime exceptions.\n\n## Methods\n### `GetAll(Guid contentTypeId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`\n- **Visibility:** `public`\n- **Parameters:**  \n  - `contentTypeId`: A `Guid` representing the type of content to filter by.  \n  - `cancellationToken`: An optional `CancellationToken` for proper cancellation support during long-running operations. Defaults to `default`.  \n\n- **Returns:**  \n  - A `Task<IEnumerable<Content>>` representing a collection of `Content` items matching the specified `contentTypeId`. An empty list will be returned if no items are found. It's important to handle this situation explicitly in your application logic to avoid null reference issues.\n\n- **Exceptions:**  \n  - `OperationCanceledException`: Thrown if the operation is canceled via the `cancellationToken`.  \n  - `MongoConnectionException`: May occur due to issues with the MongoDB connection during the execution of this method.  \n\n- **Usage Example:**  \n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    var contentRepository = new ContentRepository(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext);\n    var contents = await contentRepository.GetAll(contentTypeId, cancellationToken);\n    if (!contents.Any())\n    {\n        // Handle scenario where no contents are found.\n    }\n}\ncatch (OperationCanceledException)\n{\n    // Handle the cancellation scenario here.\n}\ncatch (MongoConnectionException ex)\n{\n    // Handle the connection error, log, or retry logic.\n}\n```\n\n- **Cancellation Handling:**  \nEnsure to call `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` at the beginning of the method to respect cancellation requests early in the operation. This allows responsive stopping of operations initiated by the user or system. It's especially important in long-running tasks, so always evaluate whether to implement cancellation when dealing with database operations.\n\n- **Data Handling:**  \nIn scenarios where no content matches the specified `contentTypeId`, an empty list is returned. Ensure your application logic appropriately handles this case to avoid null reference exceptions when processing the results.\n\n## Inheritable Methods\nThis class inherits methods from the `SiteAssociatedRepository&lt;Content&gt;`. The following methods are available for overriding:\n- `Create(Content entity)`  \n  - **Description:** Inserts a new `Content` item into the database. Override this method to add custom creation logic or validation.\n  - **Usage Example:** Implement additional validation before calling the base method.\n\n- `Update(Content entity)`  \n  - **Description:** Updates an existing `Content` item based on its Id. Override this method to enforce custom update rules or checks.\n  - **Usage Example:** Call base method but log changes for auditing.\n\n- `Delete(Guid id)`  \n  - **Description:** Deletes a `Content` item by its Id. Override this method to handle cascading deletions or other business logic.\n  - **Usage Example:** Implement logging or related entity checks before deletion.\n\n## Best Practices\n- **Cancellation Tokens:** When using cancellation tokens in your client code, ensure to pass this token throughout layers to maintain awareness of cancellation requests, especially during lengthy database operations. This helps in keeping the application responsive and avoiding resource wastage.\n\n- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for all database interactions, especially considering potential connectivity issues with MongoDB and cancellation effects during auditing and other processes.\n\n## Dependencies\n- **IMongoDBContext:** This repository requires implementing `IMongoDBContext` for repository functionalities.  \n- **IApiExecutionContext:** Context information for handling API specifics and operations.\n\n## Project Contributions\nFor contributions to the FluentCMS project, please refer to the [contribution guidelines](#).\n\n---",

It's especially important in long-running tasks.\n\n- **Data Handling:**  \nIn scenarios where no content matches the specified `contentTypeId`, an empty list is returned. Ensure your application logic appropriately handles this case to avoid null reference exceptions when processing the results.\n\n## Inheritable Methods\nThis class inherits methods from the `SiteAssociatedRepository&lt;Content&gt;`. Here’s a detailed explanation of these methods:\n\n### `Create(Content entity)`  \n  - **Description:** Inserts a new `Content` item into the database. On successful creation, the `Id` of the content is populated. Custom validation logic can be added before calling the base method. This method will throw a `MongoConnectionException` if the database operation fails.\n  - **Usage Example:** Implement additional validation before calling the base method to ensure data integrity:\n  ```csharp\n  public override async Task Create(Content entity)\n  {\n      // Example validation logic here\n      if (entity == null)\n      {\n          throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(entity), \"Content cannot be null.\");\n      }\n      await base.Create(entity);\n  }\n  ```\n\n### `Update(Content entity)`  \n  - **Description:** Updates an existing `Content` item based on its Id. If the Id does not exist, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown. Override this method to enforce custom update rules or checks. The method will not proceed if the specified entity is invalid.\n  - **Usage Example:** Call the base method but log changes for auditing:\n  ```csharp\n  public override async Task Update(Content entity)\n  {\n      // Example logging logic before update\n      await base.Update(entity);\n  }\n  ```\n\n### `Delete(Guid id)`  \n  - **Description:** Deletes a `Content` item by its Id. If no item with the specified Id exists, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown. Override this method to handle cascading deletions or other business logic, such as logging before deletion.\n  - **Usage Example:** Implement logging or related entity checks before deletion to ensure data integrity:\n  ```csharp\n  public override async Task Delete(Guid id)\n  {\n      // Check related entities or log information before deletion\n      await base.Delete(id);\n  }\n  ```\n\n### `GetById(Guid id)`  \n  - **Description:** Retrieves a single `Content` item by Id. If the Id cannot be found, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown. Use this method when you need to retrieve a specific item quickly.\n  - **Usage Example:**  \n  ```csharp\n  var content = await contentRepository.GetById(contentId);\n  if (content == null)\n  {\n      // Handle scenario where content is not found\n  }\n  ```\n\n### `Count()`  \n  - **Description:** Returns the total number of `Content` items in the database, allowing for pagination or interface updates reflecting content changes. This method is especially useful for displaying the number of records in a UI.\n  - **Usage Example:**  \n  ```csharp\n  var count = await contentRepository.Count();\n  // Display or handle count as needed\n  ```\n\n## Best Practices\n- **Cancellation Tokens:** When using cancellation tokens in your client code, ensure they are consistently passed through layers to maintain awareness of cancellation requests, especially during lengthy database operations. This practice keeps the application responsive.\n- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for all database interactions, especially considering potential connectivity issues with MongoDB. Use Retry policies for transient errors when connecting to MongoDB.\n- **Content Structure:** Ensure that your `Content` implementation adheres to the expected structure containing the necessary properties like `Id`, `TypeId`, `Title`, `Body`, and auditing fields (`CreatedOn`, `UpdatedOn`, etc.) for CRUD operations to work seamlessly.\n\n## Dependencies\n- **IMongoDBContext:** This repository requires implementation of `IMongoDBContext` for repository functionalities.  \n- **IApiExecutionContext:** Context information for handling API specifics and operations effectively.\n\n## Common Use Cases\nThe `ContentRepository` can be used in various scenarios, such as:\n- Managing different types of content for a CMS, such as blogs, articles, or multimedia items.\n- Implementing a dashboard to display or manipulate content entries based on various filters.\n- Building custom workflows that involve creating, updating, and deleting content items as part of application logic.\n\n## Project Contributions\nFor contributions to the FluentCMS project, please refer to the [contribution guidelines](#).\n",

It extends the capabilities of the `SiteAssociatedRepository` class, allowing for content-specific data operations such as creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting content items. This class plays a crucial role in managing various types of content (e.g., articles, media) throughout the application.\n\n## Properties\n### `Collection`\n- **Visibility:** `protected`  \n- **Type:** `IMongoCollection<Content>`  \n- **Description:** This property provides direct access to the MongoDB collection for performing CRUD operations on `Content` items. The `Collection` is initialized automatically in the base class `SiteAssociatedRepository<Content>` using the provided `IMongoDBContext`. It's pivotal for executing database commands pertinent to content management tasks.\n\n## Constructor\n### `ContentRepository(IMongoDBContext mongoDbContext, IApiExecutionContext apiExecutionContext)`\n- **Parameters:**  \n  - `mongoDbContext`: An instance of `IMongoDBContext`, which is **mandatory** for MongoDB operations. It establishes the connection to the database.  \n  - `apiExecutionContext`: An instance of `IApiExecutionContext`, also **mandatory**, containing context-specific information for API execution.\n\n> **Note:** Ensure that neither `mongoDbContext` nor `apiExecutionContext` is null when constructing the `ContentRepository` to prevent runtime exceptions.\n\n## Methods\n### `GetAll(Guid contentTypeId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`\n- **Visibility:** `public`  \n- **Parameters:**  \n  - `contentTypeId`: A `Guid` representing the type of content to filter by.  \n  - `cancellationToken`: An optional `CancellationToken` for proper cancellation support during long-running operations. Defaults to `default`.  \n\n- **Returns:**  \n  - A `Task<IEnumerable<Content>>` representing a collection of `Content` items matching the specified `contentTypeId`. An empty collection will be returned if no items are found without throwing an error, ensuring smooth handling in the calling logic.\n\n- **Exceptions:**  \n  - `OperationCanceledException`: Thrown if the operation is canceled via the `cancellationToken`.  \n  - `MongoConnectionException`: May occur due to issues with the MongoDB connection during execution.  \n  - `InvalidOperationException`: Thrown if the repository encounters operational issues, such as invalid filter conditions.\n\n- **Usage Example:**  \n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    var contentRepository = new ContentRepository(mongoDbContext, apiExecutionContext);\n    var contents = await contentRepository.GetAll(contentTypeId, cancellationToken);\n    if (!contents.Any())\n    {\n        // Handle scenario where no contents are found.\n    }\n}\ncatch (OperationCanceledException)\n{\n    // Handle the cancellation scenario here.\n}\ncatch (MongoConnectionException ex)\n{\n    // Handle the connection error, log, or retry logic.\n}\ncatch (InvalidOperationException ex)\n{\n    // Handle invalid operations, such as incorrect filters.\n}\n```\n\n- **Cancellation Handling:**  \nEnsure to call `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` at the start of the method to respect user or system-generated cancellation requests early on. This practice is vital in maintaining application responsiveness during long-running tasks.\n\n- **Data Handling:**  \nIf no content items match the specified `contentTypeId`, an empty collection is returned. Always ensure that your application logic correctly handles this case to avoid potential null reference exceptions while processing the results.\n\n## Inheritable Methods\nThe `ContentRepository` overrides several methods from the `SiteAssociatedRepository&lt;Content&gt;`. Specifics are as follows:\n\n### `Create(Content entity)`  \n  - **Description:** Inserts a new `Content` item into the database. On successful creation, the `Id` of the content is populated. Override this method to implement custom validation logic prior to calling the base method. This method can throw a `MongoConnectionException` if the database operation fails.\n  - **Usage Example:**  \n```csharp\npublic override async Task Create(Content entity)\n{\n    // Example validation logic here\n    if (entity == null)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(entity), \"Content cannot be null.\");\n    }\n    await base.Create(entity);\n}\n```\n\n### `Update(Content entity)`  \n  - **Description:** Updates an existing `Content` item based on its Id. If the Id does not exist in the database, it throws an `InvalidOperationException`. Override this method to enforce any additional business logic regarding updates. This method will not carry out the update operation if the specified entity is invalid.\n  - **Usage Example:**  \n```csharp\npublic override async Task Update(Content entity)\n{\n    // Example logging logic before the update\n    if (entity == null)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(entity), \"Content cannot be null.\");\n    }\n    await base.Update(entity);\n}\n```\n\n### `Delete(Guid id)`  \n  - **Description:** Deletes a `Content` item using its Id. If no item with the specified Id exists, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown. You may override this method to implement custom functions for cascading deletions or executing specific business logic, such as logging prior to deletion.\n  - **Usage Example:**  \n```csharp\npublic override async Task Delete(Guid id)\n{\n    // Check related entities or log information before deletion\n    await base.Delete(id);\n}\n```\n\n### `GetById(Guid id)`  \n  - **Description:** Retrieves a single `Content` item based on its Id. If the Id cannot be found, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown. Use this method for quick access to a specific item.\n  - **Usage Example:**  \n```csharp\nvar content = await contentRepository.GetById(contentId);\nif (content == null)\n{\n    // Handle scenario where content is not found\n}\n```\n\n### `Count()`  \n  - **Description:** Returns the total number of `Content` items within the database, facilitating pagination or interface updates reflecting content changes. Particularly useful for displaying the total number of records in a user interface.\n  - **Usage Example:**  \n```csharp\nvar count = await contentRepository.Count();\n// Display or handle count as needed\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n- **Cancellation Tokens:** Always pass cancellation tokens through various layers of your application to ensure immediate responsiveness to cancellation requests, particularly for lengthy data operations. This consistency is crucial for building responsive applications.\n- **Error Handling:** Adopt comprehensive error handling strategies for all database interactions, especially taking into account the potential for connectivity issues with MongoDB. Implement retry policies for transient errors when establishing connections to MongoDB.\n- **Content Structure:** Confirm that your `Content` structure adheres to the anticipated design, possessing essential properties such as `Id`, `TypeId`, `Title`, `Body`, and auditing fields (`CreatedOn`, `UpdatedOn`, etc.) to facilitate seamless CRUD operations.\n\n## Dependencies\n- **IMongoDBContext:** This repository necessitates an implementation of `IMongoDBContext` to function effectively.  \n- **IApiExecutionContext:** It provides crucial context information for managing API-specific operations.\n\n## Common Use Cases\nThe `ContentRepository` serves various scenarios, including:\n- Handling different types of content within a CMS (e.g., articles, blogs, multimedia).  \n- Implementing dashboards to showcase or modify content entries based on preset filters.  \n- Constructing custom workflows for creating, updating, and deleting content items as part of the application's logic.\n\n## Project Contributions\nFor contributions to the FluentCMS project, please refer to the [contribution guidelines](#).",
