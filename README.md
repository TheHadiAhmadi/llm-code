# LLM Code Project
This project aims to assist developers in understanding a codebase using a language model (LLM), providing functionalities like code review, documentation generation, code writing, and completion. The project focuses on enhancing developer productivity through automated tools and AI assistance.

## Features
- Comprehensive code indexing for better comprehension.
- Code review capabilities using AI.
- Automatic documentation generation.
- User prompts for tailored assistance.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Package dependencies are managed via npm.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
